For the extra credit: 
	HW4: We added Particle Systems to all of the goals, and we also added a particle system to 	the marble that only turns on temporarily (for 3 seconds) when it collides with a goal. 


	HW5: We added a power up sphere that increases the player health by 25 and disappears when the player collides with it.
